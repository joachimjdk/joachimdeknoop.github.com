            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>As a brand ambassador at Geninc from January 2020 to September 2022, I excelled in a high-pressure environment where my pursuit of excellence and high performance was not just necessary but thrived. My role encompassed recruiting, coaching, and managing teams, where leadership and people management skills were honed. This experience has provided me with a solid foundation in sales, marketing, and team leadership.
            In my role at Intersport where I'm currently working since January 2023, I engaged with the dynamic world of retail, gaining invaluable insights into consumer behavior and the factors driving the sports retail market. This experience solidified my understanding of retail management, including inventory control, sales optimization, and customer engagement strategies.</p>
